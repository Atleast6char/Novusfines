[[Lucius Thormund|Lucius's]] mansion is here and might be a place we return to often, given they are the de facto leader.

The relationship between the common-class and the [[Jimothy Richard Kinkannon|previous sector]] here wasn't great, but wasn't terrible either. Jimothy performed his duties, but his interactions with the locals were only just enough to keep his imperial cog oiled and turning, and not much else. Either Jimothy was content to meet the bare minimum asked of him, or he kept himself busy with other affairs.
