Name pending.
One of the main strongholds The Empire has in the New World. Strongholds, as the name suggests, are highly fortified positions. However, it is not like they serve a strictly military role. More than anything, these reinforced settlements are like the distribution centers to their surrounding townships, the arteries that supply the veins.

Until very recently, most [[Aliloide]] were kept to these strongholds or other greatly developed settlements. It would be hard to guess why the change is occurring without knowing why the Aliloide were so sheltered in the first place, though one might guess it has something to do with [[Devorticism - The Faith|The Faith]].

[[Sheijhey]] spent most of his life here, learned his craft here and became a member of the [[Medica & Research Mandatum]] here. His handler was [[Samantha Vain]].
