An older fella, and New World born. Possesses long-ish silver hair with a goatee and mustache. All well kempt. For all his hygiene however, there was nothing he could do for his moderately crooked teeth. Lucius has an easy-going air about him that can be read on just his face or posture, though he still dresses to suit his role--professionally, with a hint of excess to show some of that imperial wealth. He is probably a human, and a thinner man, pointedly atypical from the rotund paper pushers of those who would hold a similar office as he. And lastly, Lucius has a marking of chains on his cheek. ^6b0e35

Lucius is a man who is very good with his words, and enjoys using them. Perhaps too much.

Lucius was installed in [[Milbrook]] as a [[Sectors|sector]] to replace the [[Jimothy Richard Kinkannon|last one]], who spontaneously went missing. In addition to catching up on their long overdue administrative work, Lucius was also tasked with leading an investigation to discover how or why his predecessor disappeared. He quickly finds that his predecessor did not garner that much respect from the laborers of Milbrook, not to any degree that it was a detriment to his work, but it was bad enough to preemptively color Lucius, Jimothy's successor, in an unfavorable light. By appearances, Lucius wishes to amend this going forward.

While pursuing Jimothy's vanishing act, Lucius uncovered what was probably Jimothy's last contact while he was still accounted for. The new sector swiftly sniffed them out, though found this person was strangely someone with no involvement or relation to The Empire, which only served to deepen the mystery he was trying to illuminate.

After a bizarrely tense talk with this [[Ash's Character|non-empire aligned person]] about Lucius's purpose and goals, along with a great deal of apprehension, they eventually agreed to make a magically binding vow, swearing to transparency with each other in matters regarding Jimothy's disappearance, and past conduct with Ash's character. Though not part of the vow, Lucius was also convinced to give Ash's character some authority while they closely followed the matter of Jimothy.

> [!quote] I, Lucius, hereby vow that to the Livyeris that I shall be forthcoming in all matters concerning the disappearance of Jimothy. That all Jimothy sought and intended will not be withheld, as well as any information he gathered of her and what information he may have gained in knowing her. I vow to respect the covenant set by the one before me in regards to the secretive location of this garden and similar matters of personal privacy unless otherwise agreed upon.
