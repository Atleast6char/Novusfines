Carlisle is a human man and a father (of the faith). He has short black hair with a chin strap beard, all which is meticulously well groomed. He possess an exceeding neutral resting face, stands a little above 6 feet tall, and has these large, calloused hands. It terms of physique, Carlisle is lean, but not scrawny. He wears faith standard attire and carries a staff to assist with walking[^1]. Lastly, he appears to be middle aged, neither exceedingly young or old, and he hails from the motherland. ^9f0a7c

Carlisle is also a Father within his [[Devorticism - The Faith|faith]], and is followed by a young sprout of the same belief, [[Duncan Cloth]]. Their relationship, besides the obvious, is not well understood at this time, assuming there is anything to read into. For the time being, Duncan may just be a set of limbs to help the good father, who is not getting any younger.

He was briefly in charge of escorting [[Sheijhey]] and [[The Letter|a letter]] to [[Lucius Thormund|Milbrook's new sector]], while also having standing orders from the [[The Archbishop]] to investigate the [[Jimothy Richard Kinkannon|previous sector]], who was under suspicion of misusing magic.

[^1]: Uncertain whether he is just prepared to travel great distances, or if this was an attempt to hint that he buggered his leg in the past.
