An [[Aliloide]] male of few remarkable features when compared to the rest of his kind. Sheijhey sports a messy, coarse, medium-length ponytail of a dusty orange color. He stands around 5 feet tall (not including his horns) and wears a sleeveless vest over a baggy, short-sleeved shirt, neither of which can be helped given an Aliloide's arm membranes. Despite the lack of choice in the matter, his fit does appear to be comfortable and travel ready. And speaking of travel ready, Sheijhey is armed to the teeth in straps, bags and clasps, which allows him to carry an absurd amount of goods. Also, Sheijhey does not take part in the Aliloide tradition to decorate their face. ^04bd6a

Sheijhey spent most of his life under the care of [[Samantha Vain]]. When he was young, he was allowed to explore the area near his [[Northern Stronghold|home]] quite a bit, but once he became an accomplished [[Medica & Research Mandatum|alchemist]], he fell under stricter watch, and came to be handled quite delicately. This did not last however. As of [[1 - Introductions|now]], Sheijhey has been transferred to a new handler, the [[Lucius Thormund|new sector of Milbrook]], who has within a day, taken him out to travel.

Seems to have a passing interest in [[The Letter|the letter]] that was delivered alongside himself to Lucius.
