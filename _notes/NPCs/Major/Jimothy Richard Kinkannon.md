The previous [[Sectors|sector]], operating from [[Milbrook]]. He very suddenly went missing one day, and as such, has fallen behind all his official duties. He was eventually replaced by [[Lucius Thormund]], who also has the added responsibility of finding out what happened to Jimothy.

While Lucius went digging through all of Jimothy's stuff, and found several articles that suggested the previous sector was very taken with something be he vanished, and it was a highly odd something, not normally a thing a sector would have any business meddling with personally. This was as likely a lead as any, and upon studying it further, Lucius was able to find Jimothy's probable [[Ash's Character|last contact]] before his truancy. And strangely, this individual was not a citizen of The Empire.

Presumed a human male. Also presumed dead by Ash's Character, guessing he was taken by some kind of ambiguous, supernatural force/entity. If Lucius's outspoken image of the typical sector is to be believed, Jimothy may have been a portly man.
