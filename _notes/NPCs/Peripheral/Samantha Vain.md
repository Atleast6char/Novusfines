She charged [[Carlisle]] with the duty of escorting [[Sheijhey]] to the new [[Lucius Thormund|sector]] in [[Milbrook]]. Notably she appears to be part of the same [[Devorticism - The Faith|sect]] and rank as Carlisle. During his short stay in the [[Northern Stronghold]], they got rather acquainted with one another.

Samantha was Sheijhey's handler until he was abruptly transferred. It is a safe assumption she spent most of her time in this stronghold with Sheijhey.
