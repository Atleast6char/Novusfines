# Day 1
## Inauguration
`1:51` ~ `19:50`
The curtain pulls away to reveal [[Lucius Thormund|Lucius]] being inaugurated as a new [[sectors|sector]], a person of significance, of power and wealth in the [[The New World|New World]]. The intention behind this is two-fold, to replace [[Jimothy Richard Kinkannon|Jimothy]], another sector who'd gone missing, and as well to insert someone who can investigate the oddity of their disappearance.

Normally such a process would have a longer screening duration, as well as a heap of formalities to climb over, but everyone present today is spared from the usual traditions. Each of them knows another wave, a massive one, of motherland settlers have already made shore, and it is their united wish that this blemish upon their ledgers be dealt with before they get time to settle in. ^cafed2

Lucius receives a set of keys, as well as a silver medallion--which will act as his proof of office. A priest utters an incantation and spills a drop of Lucius's blood upon the emblem, binding him to it in an unmistakeable working of magic. The spell is explained to grant him extra privacy with his work, as well as access to all the articles which were under similar lock and key for the last sector.

> _Lucius got_ **3** _corruption!_
> Dart also drops some grim & perilous changes made to the corruption system he's been cooking up. This includes corruption no longer resetting at the end of a session.

And so Lucius departs immediately for his new manor at [[Milbrook]], one of the several townships he now presides over. He finds his workplace in a sorry state. Functional, but sorry. And it is also abandoned, like it were haunted or something. He eventually navigates his way to his physical office, and oh god its even worse in here. Papers, books and dust absolutely everywhere. It's a trial just to walk to his seat.

> Lucius does a scrutinize!
> **13**! Success!

> [!quote] "Great start!" 
> -- Tim, unaware of his future.

Many of the documents Lucius looks through are nothing to write home about, finding them all typical of a sector to have. Although as someone who is meant to collect on neglected tithes, even these must be inspected meticulously, no matter how little it helps with his investigation. However, as he reads on, he does find that Jimothy's writing is odd to follow. Much of the time it is impeccable and easy to pick through, yet at other times it's erratic, enough so to suspect that they may have been under the influence some nights. That, or it was authored by another hand, but this seems unlikely given the security this was found behind.

Among all the sifting, Lucius does eventually find something that tickles his investigation sense--a matter which Jimothy must of written about, that took an exceeding amount their time and attention. What this was though, was left to our imaginations to ponder.

> [!quote] Holy moly!
> -- Tim upon receiving what we can only assume was a wall of text from Dart.
## Heralds of the Fleet
`19:51` ~ `45:48`
Carlisle has been at sea for 6 months, and is very happy to finally be on his feet as he docks near the [[Northern Stronghold]]. He was just one person of many, from a very large fleet to arrive[^1], but in spite the immense bustle this generated, Carlisle's first days back on solid ground were relatively uneventful.

The day of the new sector's inauguration also happens to be the same day that Carlisle is asked by the [[The Archbishop]] to investigate the missing sector, Jimothy, who is suspected of foul play of the arcane variety. It is also _"heavily implied"_ that the military sect is oblivious to this potential corruption bubbling just underfoot[^2]. What or how we are meant to take that information is suggestive at best, and ambiguous at worst.

Carlisle then meets with [[Samantha Vain]], who asks if the former could do her a favor. She explains she is in charge of someone who is being transferred, and it just so happens that their destination is the same as theirs. Also, she has [[The Letter|a letter]] for who ever inherits this transfer. And so, Carlisle is introduced to [[Sheijhey]], the escortee, and they briefly introduce themselves.

> [[Duncan Cloth|Duncan]] was here this whole time, don't worry about it.
> [[Carlisle#^9f0a7c|Carlisle's Description]]
> [[Sheijhey#^04bd6a|Sheijhey's Description]]
> [[Duncan Cloth#^6912f4|Duncan's Description]]

> [!quote] Yikes
> -- Ash bullying Ron for not coloring his art work.

The Father is very polite, dubbing Sheijhey as a _"revered one"_ in his greeting. Whether by some shyness, or lack of regard for the moniker, the Aliloide quickly waves this greeting off, then they move on to exchanging their actual names. Its a little stiff, especially Sheijhey, but it closes out without any trouble, then the group sets out on their walk down a relatively short, well-trodden path.
## A Unique Quartet
`45:49` ~ `1:15:25`
Right away, Sheijhey draws a lot of attention from the common-folk at Milbrook by merely existing. Gossip rapidly spreading about how the Aliloide were supposedly being moved to the _marginally_ less secure settlements, and now the proof was in the pudding. But no one actually stops them, so they arrive at the manor and meet the new sector.

> [[Lucius Thormund#^6b0e35|Lucius's Appearance]]

Another round of introductions commences while Lucius also receives the letter intended for him. Lucius also happened to identify a sash worn by Sheijhey, indicating that he is part of the [[Medica & Research Mandatum]], or plainly, he's an alchemist. Lucius takes some interest in this, inquiring as to the source of his education, with Sheijhey responding rather flatly out of habit.

> [!quote] -he told me how to throw things into a bowl, and how to hit them until they were useful.
> -- Sheijhey's synopsis of his job.

With the platitudes out of the way, the resident sector returns to business and starts outlining to the group what things has his immediate attention and needs dealing with, starting with the tithe collecting. While he lets everyone digest the details, Lucius fetches the letter from his pocket and decides now's the time to read. Unless someone could read his lips as he perused the parchment, the contents of the letter were not made known to anyone else. Carlisle also makes some small talk with Sheijhey, asking if he was New World born, which he confirms. The father also ponders the same question in regards to Lucius with Sheijhey guessing he is probably motherland-born. Lucius soundly denies this moments later.

> Sheijhey 0 - Lucius 1

Having finished his reading, Lucius admits to having quite a bit more on his plate than just the tithes. He then asks the party about each of their circles of information, so that he might start concocting some plans to handle his other duties. Unfortunately, with the Aliloide being exceptionally sheltered, and Carlisle having only touched down a week ago, neither are able to contribute. Lucius continues by saying he knew of Jimothy by name and position, but was never really acquainted, never answering to him for anything. In their absence, he comments that he believes the previous sector may have gotten himself into a situation where he bit off more than he could chew, but rather than expounding upon that, they instead reassured that he have no intentions to mirror Jimothy's methods and unnecessary risks.

Then, finally, we are informed about what we'll be actually doing. Lucius has his eyes on [[Sernwatch]], a further out settlement where he can allegedly learn more about Jimothy, or at least retrace his last known, recently discovered steps. While doing this, it seems Lucius plans on making use of Sheijhey's and Carlisle's talents, possibly in a maneuver to quickly gain the favor of those who suddenly find themselves as his subjects.

> [!quote] That is a really long way to say its okay, but thank you.
> -- Sheijhey showing gratitude to Lucius.

> [!quote] A jibberjabber...? A spook! A hocus-pocus! You're not familiar with the such?
> -- Lucius giving his company a thorough taste of his extraordinary vernaculars.

With their game plan sorted, the new sector heads out to prepare for their imminent travel and rectify the matter of his truant staff. The others follow him while he goes to do this.

> Take Five!
## Sour Reception
`1:25:24` ~ `2:04:31`
Lucius quickly rounds up his subjects and makes a speech about the work that needs to get done, but in such a way where it doesn't sound like he's eagerly throwing his weight around. His phrasing is very deliberate, trying to illicit a natural motivation to get things cleaned up.

> Lucius rolls an intimidate!
> **77**! _Critical Failure!_
> Lucius rerolls with **Mastermind**!
> **85**! Failure!

It does not go over well, as mutterings in the crowd suggest they have no confidence that their new sector will be staying long. The reason for this strong belief goes unexplained, but there is a hint of something the past sector must've done that colors the perspective of their former subjects. Despite the poor rolls though, the workers do slowly form their ranks and begin getting a move on.

After this, Lucius decides everyone aught to do some shopping, first starting with a cart/carriage for their trip tomorrow, whereby everyone meets [[Bruce Stallion]]. And he is a man sitting on some words about Jimothy. They begin by describing Jimothy as a bit of a flighty sort--though perhaps not too atypical of a sector who has their share of chickens to count. Then he tells of how, shortly before their disappearance, Jimothy picked up a strange habit of selling all his _worldly belongings,_ and among those sales were some horses--the like it seems Lucius may want to purchase back, or at least rent out. Lucius makes the appropriate arrangements to secure these with terms which are agreeable to Bruce.

The shopping and sleuthing continues, and no matter where he goes, Lucius hears more of the same thing from the stalls and storehouse employees. Jimothy was definitely acting strange the last while that he was around, several individuals seconding what Bruce said about his wanton sales of his private possessions. He acquired some hefty coin in all that business, but to anyone's knowledge, very little of it was ever spent. Or at least, it wasn't spent locally. Upon further probing from Lucius, he finds that Jimothy's requisition of property and goods was still done mostly on fair grounds, but towards his last weeks in power, his erratic-ness spilled into his requisitioning, leaving a stain on their middling reputation. Still, he never confiscated so much that he left those under him bereft or destitute.

As Lucius amassed more intel, he also green lit some purchase orders of Sheijhey's and Carlisle's, so long as the alchemist agreed to make him some of those new fangled fireworks the good father brought up[^3]. They seem to think this is a good way to illicit wonder in those who are less initiated the more advanced culture found in imperial strongholds.

> Sheijhey rolls alchemy **5** times![^4]
> **09**! **31**! **69**!_(Nice!)_ **59**! **30**! _All automatic critical successes!_
> Sheijhey crafts **3** fireworks, **4** bottle bombs and **4** laudanum.

Before the day comes to a close, Lucius has yet another thing to explain to the rest of the group. Now that they are following in Jimothy's footsteps, they should know that in the last missive the new sector found of his, it was an itinerary that revealed that he did not depart alone. He went missing in spite of taking a small measure of military might with him. However, Lucius promptly implies it might be for this very reason that Jimothy vanished, and he plans to approach this with more discretion than his predecessor had. The group mostly seems on board with this approach, but hardly with any enthusiasm.

# Day 2
## Date in the Garden
`2:04:32` ~ `3:01:35`
Lucius fine-tunes the composition of their troop, choosing their steeds/beasts of burden going forward, as well as considering taking up an extra hand to deal with the additional work load. Which means more bartering with our dear skeptic, Bruce. This goes well, Lucius departing with everything he needed, plus one [[Henry Stable]] as a driver, and leaving Bruce with a better opinion of the new sector of Milbrook.

> Some addendums are made to the travel times made in this section. This document will try to reflect these changes proactively.

Not too long passes before the party finds themselves in the thick of a forest, with Lucius making silent mental notes about the Fae and other things he learned while reading what was effectively Jimothy's diary. There is a great emphasis on his decorum while he meets whoever he plans to, and a strong recommendation that he seeks this audience alone. There is a minor deviation involved to get where he is going, a measly 10 or so minute detour from the usual path that'd get them to Sernwatch. Once more, this is passed along to the group, but on more of a need-to-know basis. There is some verbal back and forth to feel out the mood of this meeting, but ultimately ends with everyone taking this opportunity to chill and look for herbs at Sheijhey's request, while Lucius marches off with one of the fireworks, aiming to use it as a kind of peace offering.

> Lucius rolls for awareness!
> **99**! _Critical Failure!_

Lucius tramples on everything that is beautiful, young, supple, or any combination of these 3 things on the way to [[The Garden]]. And of course, there is [[Ash's Character|someone]] here to witness the travesty that his uncultured steps carves into the land. He treads like a man who butters bread with a cheese grater and no fingers.

> [!quote] Aw fuck n' aw shit, man...! Awww, m-my apologies!
> -- Lucius, when his feet takes no prisoners.

> [[Ash's Character#^278674|Ash's Character's Appearance]]

The tall woman stands to her full height and casts an unimpressed look upon Lucius, then requests (demands?) that he identify himself. For a moment he is startled, but then slowly he removes his hat and enters an especially emphatic bow. Introductions commence with a surrendering of Lucius's gift, which feels more like a token of apology at this point. The conversation lingers on this gifted firework for sometime, with the sector talking it up like its the second coming of Devorden, and the recipient fighting to constantly low her expectation of it. Eventually Ash's Character steers the discussion back towards pertinent things, asking again about who Lucius really is, and for what purpose do they seek this meeting.

Lucius is upfront about how he learned about this place and mentions how she is the last known contact Jimothy had, thus his interest in meeting her. She questions if Lucius was told this information, and he answers negatively, saying it was more owed to his prying than anything. Ash's Character flatly responds that regardless of how he learned of her and this place, it should not have been possible, were he to have kept his promise to her. Although Jimothy did not appear to maliciously break his NDA, our fish friend is firm in stipulating that the information he left behind, whether done privately or not, was a breach of their agreement.

In an attempt to gain the blue woman's favor, Lucius expresses that he would do what Jimothy could not, and maintain the sacredness of this place--then citing the marking of chains upon his cheek as a credible proof for his honesty.

> Ash's Character rolls Folklore!
> **#**! Failure!

This brand means nothing to Ash's Character, so the new sector simply explains that it makes him an outlier amongst those who hold a similar seat to himself, and that he is unafraid to bend some rules, if it means it'll keeps the peace. The receiver of these words remains woefully unconvinced while this promise remains as mere talk, highly resistant to repeating her mistakes with Jimothy. So she purposes an oath...

> Lucius rolls Folklore!
> **52**! Success!

...which immediately sends Lucius reeling! He aggressively back pedals, trying to look for another way to consummate an agreement, but Ash's Character is still not having it.

> [!quote] But I brought gifts.
> -- Lucius to Ash's character

The faintly panicked sector admits to being inexperienced and makes it known that he desires for things to go a bit slower, and for Ash's Character to be a bit gentler with him. She considers this, and comes to a realization that this man may truly not after her garden, and is indeed just looking for his compatriot. Yet she remains steadfast about going in dry and having that oath. 

Lucius manages to side track this into a back and forth, where they each ask each other a question. Ash's Character begins by asking what is it precisely Lucius is seeking from her, and gets a more detailed regaling of what he learned in Jimothy's notes--more or less asking for confirmation, also if there was more to their agreement than just an NDA, and lastly, which of Jimothy's loose ends was he fixing to tie up before he met his _'untimely fate.'_ The blue-skinned woman confirms what she can and says that she was more of a counsellor to Jimothy. She never directed him to anything. He always had questions, and she often had warnings. Warnings that she is confident were ignored, and was finding this conversation taking a very similar shape.

She goes on to mention that some of this danger could've been alleviated if Jimothy brought the right kind of company, namely someone like herself, but she digresses while Lucius swoops in and inquires if he can take that as a recommendation. Impressively, she tolerates the suggestion, but only if he agrees to her prior terms, to vow on a pact of discretion, as well as sharing information with each other regarding this ordeal. Then she doubles down by adding that she wants unquestioned authority while dealing with matters of her expertise. Lucius agrees to this much more readily than he ever did the vow, but does finally cave after one more failed attempt to broker his version of a deal.

> Ash's Character rolls for Incantation!
> **#**! Failure!
> Ash's Character rerolls with a Fortune point!
> **#**! _Critical Success!_

> [!quote] I, Lucius, hereby vow that to the Livyeris that I shall be forthcoming in all matters concerning the disappearance of Jimothy. That all Jimothy sought and intended will not be withheld, as well as any information he gathered of her and what information he may have gained in knowing her. I vow to respect the covenant set by the one before me in regards to the secretive location of this garden and similar matters of personal privacy unless otherwise agreed upon.
> -- The Vow
## Cliff Hanger
`3:01:36` ~ `3:26:36`
With the proceedings past, Ash's Character officially joins the troop! Lucius asked if he can warn everyone first before he introduces her to everyone else. She accepts after a line of questioning, to ensure he doesn't intend to break his vow within minutes of making it. Fortunately, this does not appear to be their intent, and he has her blessing to scurry forth.

Before the sector returns to the trio + Henry, they did do that herb gathering the Sheijhey wanted.

> Sheijhey rolls for survival with flip to fail!
> **#**! Failure!
> Carlisle & Duncan rolls for survival!
> **#**! **#**! Success!
> The party receives **3 Red-Capped Mushrooms** & **That gooood shit.**

A wild Lucius emerges! He warns everyone of a blue woman that is following him, but to not be alarmed because he's into it. He also takes this moment to ask Carlisle what's the word on magic in the motherland, to which he answers "Oh, its worst. But perfectly legal." _(not verbatim)_  Everyone slowly nods and gives the go ahead for Lucius's stalker to reveal themself, and everyone is very impressed by how blue she is. She's so blue that even Sheijhey can tell, and he's borderline blind. Henry experiences an _awakening,_ which does not go unnoticed.

We promptly hit the ol' dusty trail again, while listening to Ash's Character about what we can expect going forward. Though she cannot comment on any specifics, she gives a loose outline as to what she suspects they'll find. Plenty of corruption and wild, untethered magic. This gives Carlisle a bit of an itch he wants to service, and queries into (the source of?) this/her magic. She speaks of something called "The Weavings" and a people long gone, from a certain place[^5]. Nothing gets elaborated on, other than voicing the likely possibility that Jimothy discovered this font of magic, and he was not going to be able to walk away from it.

> Short talk about travel time amendments.

Nearing Sernwatch now, the party hits another snag. We spot an on going conflict, and a certainly odd looking one at that. There are several Barghest attacking what seems to be a small band of ordinary folk, as well a large [[Nick's Character|snake woman]] who seems to be, by all appearances, allies with the villagers.

[^1]: Incidentally the same fleet hinted at [[#^cafed2|here]]. So this technically takes place before "Day 1." But since nothing eventful happened, it'll remain formatted like this.
[^2]: This may not necessarily be true, or at least the part about their obliviousness may not be. After all, Lucius was tasked to investigate the same man on the same day. But it does sound like The Faith is comparatively more informed.
[^3]: It is hinted that Sheijhey buys some _unnecessary_ things, along with Dart revealing that Sheijhey definitely knows a thing or 2 about gunpowder. However, he is not eager to reveal his cards just yet.
[^4]: 2 of these rolls are actually made after the session ended, but this is when they would've been made in the timeline.
[^5]: Where ever Jimothy went?
