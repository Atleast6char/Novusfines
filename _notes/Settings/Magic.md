A thing of fear for some, and opportunity for others--one man's spiritual food, and another's wicked demons given form. All this to say that magic is a tumultuous thing, where a conjuring of it can grant a person protection while corrupting them in the same spell. One hand giveth, while the other taketh away.

[[Devorticism - The Faith|The Faith]] seems to have a history with magic, although it is not something that is explicitly profane. They do however go to great lengths to monitor how and where it is used, and define what is an abuse of this craft.

The breadth of things which magic can do is too broad to tell in detail, for even with a single school/arcana of magic, there can be quite the variation.
