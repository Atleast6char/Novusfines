# Culture & Place
Aliloide are a timid race that enjoys decorating their faces, despite their poor eyesight. That said, this habit of theirs isn‚Äôt driven by a visual appeal, but touch instead. Aliloide can identify people accurately by touching their face, even being able distinguish the health of individuals by something as nuanced as the quality of their skin. These facial decorations, or ‚ÄúElus,‚Äù are meant to enhance their features to solidify a courtship interest into a formal pairing. Although the Elus serve this function, the touching of another's face can just be a mere greeting--however such a thing is reserved for family and the occasional close friend. Otherwise, an Aliloide would default to identifying people by their unique vocal signatures.

They also enjoy decorating their horns, draping anything shiny on them, being among the few things their lacking vision can detect without being rather close. This appears to be more for themselves than anything however, and is taken to be a sign of comfortable living, or even luxury, by others of their kind.

## In the Empire
[[The Haldriatic Empire|The Empire]] is no stranger to having other races in their chiefly human-run nation. Most races are happenstance acquisitions made by their ravenous desire to expand, with the Aliloide being no different. The Aliloide largely did not resist this assimilation, and began their tenure in this foreign society as many other non-human races did--as a low class laborer, somewhere between slave and citizen.

But they were not firmly fastened to this fate as others were, and they found themselves in humanity's good graces before long. No Aliloide claims to understand how it came to pass, but it was the human's religion that gave them respite, their exalted declaring that Aliloide were actually a kind of divine race, and deserving of special care [^1].

And so it was that Aliloide became a protected kind, still expected to earn their keep to an extent, but none-the-less delighted by their more favorable conditions.
## In the New World
The Empire's grip on things is notably looser here than in their motherland, and so the average Aliloide finds themselves living a much more conventional life, despite still being beholden to all the same customs, technically. They are still protected, but on these untamed shores, everyone is expected to contribute to the empire's expeditions.

A notable observation about the Aliloide here, compared to their home across the ocean, is that they are made to move around a lot when they're young. Apparently to wherever their services are required, even though on paper they provide nothing that another cannot [^2]. This movement was primarily only done between the empire's main outposts, but very recently they've been allowed to work on the outer fringes.

# Physiology
A fully grown Aliloide stands about 5 feet tall excluding horns, gaining 4~6 inches including them. They are typically a snowy-white color, with thin black slits for eyes, round leaning faces, and pale golden horns which grow straight upwards from the sides of the forehead. They possess leaner builds, though have well developed shoulder and back muscles to accommodate the membranes that hang from their arms. These membranes hang down shy of 3 feet at their longest point, and are capable of flexing & squeezing things with surprising dexterity, though still outperformed by their hands. Aliloide have awful long distance eyesight, but more than make up for it with their superb hearing, which may surprise people when they notice they do not have ears. Indeed, Aliloide in fact hear with their horns, and have a very unique way of perceiving sound. Aliloide have 4 digits on their hands and feet, and their outer-most digits on each are slightly opposed from the rest. They still have what you might consider a thumb, which is notably more opposed than the rest of their opposed digits.

Aliloide are natively nocturnal, often exhibiting higher energy at night. Probably the most bizarre facet of their biology is how fast they can reach their full size, usually finishing their filling out around 9 or 10. They become sexually mature about the time they finish growing, though Aliloide aren‚Äôt considered adults by their own kind until their 12th year. This is subject to some flexibility, as their kind routinely adopts other cultural norms into their own, for the sake of peace keeping, or perhaps their characteristic timidness. Aliloide have short life spans compared to many other humanoid races, a healthy, well cared for specimen will succumb to age in their late 50s to 60s. Perhaps it is owed to being surrounded by longer lived species, that Aliloide ended up being more virile to compensate, often gestating 2~4 children at a time. An Aliloide without a brother or sister is a rare thing indeed.

# Language
Alilien is a very soft spoken tongue, and in many senses the polar opposite of Dwarven. Aliloide try to avoid the use of harsh consonants, reserving them only for their harsh words. This language is quite primitive though, lacking words for some concepts easily described in other tongues. It is rather common for them to inject words or phrases from other languages seamlessly into their own, assuming they know another. When naming things in Alilien, they enjoy having a kind of auditory repetition. Some examples of this would be Wara, Rolroi, and Sheijhey. Most names in Alilien are unisex.
