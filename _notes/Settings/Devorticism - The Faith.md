The solely recognized faith of [[The Haldriatic Empire|The Empire]], and a substantial power within it. Devorticism is a monotheistic religion that venerates their first emperor, a man who'd become a god, Devorden[^1]. The primary symbol of the Devortic Church is a 'Greek cross,' or symmetrical cross, often depicted in gold.

The church operates out of 8 main sects, one for each of Devorticism _virtues_, plus another for their Justiciars/Inquisitors. The tenants and qualities The Faith embodies are: Order, Justice, Redemption, Mercy, Compassion, Devotion and Humility. There is a bishop at the head of every sect, save for the Justiciars, and above them is the [[The Archbishop|Archbishop]] and [[Lord High Chancellor|High Chancellor]]. There are also many branches that make up each sect, but these are formed much more liberally and as needed.

The Faith also seems to make it their business to teach about magic, in a manner that speaks to its capacity for danger and misuse. In the [[The New World|New World]], The Faith's approach to those who channel the arcane does not seem all that different from how they would conduct themselves in the motherland. They keep a vigilant watch for it, and police its use greatly, despite it not being explicitly illegal/sacrilegious to perform.
